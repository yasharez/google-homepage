First Odin Project project. Recreate the google home page with html and css basics.
Took around two weeks of on and off work. Learned a lot while working on this. 
It was nice to implement flexbox in css and better understand how it works in real time.
Originally hard coded the magnifying glass and mic icon because I didn't know how to embed in a <input> element. However I realized that on a different monitor the icons would be outside the search bar due to absolute positioning.
I had to make a change to my layout and create a flexbox for the search bar as well as the icons. Probably not the best way to do it. But it got the job done for this project.
Overall it went well, I enjoyed putting together the webpage. Onto the next project!
