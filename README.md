First Odin Project project. Recreate the google home page with html and css basics.
Took around two weeks of on and off work. Learned a lot while working on this. 
It was nice to implement flex in css and better understand how it works in real time.
Had to hard code some of the images in the search box but that was becasue I didn't know how to embed an <svg> element into a <input> element without the file itself in my folder.
Overall it went well, I enjoyed putting together the webpage. Onto the next project!
